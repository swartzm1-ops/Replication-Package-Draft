# STA-145-Final-Project
### My replication package for my STA-145 final project.  I took the data of the New Jersey legislator and analyzed many facts about each legislator, most importantly sexuality and party. I sought to figure out if one party had more LGQBT+ members than other. 
## Instructions
### To access and utilize the script, open the "swartzm1-finalproject.R" file, which contains the code for my project. To access the dataset, open the "Politics 4-NJ Leg - Data Table Tabular (1).csv" file.
## Data
### The data collected for this project focused on members of the New Jersey Legislature, with the goal of examining the relationship between legislators’ sexuality and their political party affiliation. The primary objective of the analysis was to determine whether any notable patterns or correlations exist between these two variables. I analyzed the dataset by identifying each legislator’s party, categorizing their sexuality based on publicly available information, and recording additional relevant demographic details. This allowed me to compare trends across groups and evaluate how these patterns aligned with my original expectations.
## Operationalization 
### Sexuality in this study was measured as a simple binary variable: each legislator was coded as either LGBT or non-LGBT based on publicly available and verifiable information. This approach ensured that no assumptions were made about anyone’s identity and that only confirmed, public declarations were included. By using a binary measure, sexuality became a clearly defined characteristic that could be compared across legislators, making it possible to examine whether openly LGBT individuals are distributed evenly across political parties or concentrated within one.

### Political party was also operationalized as a binary variable by classifying each legislator as either a Democrat or a Republican, based on official listings from the New Jersey Legislature’s website. This coding reflected the state’s two-party structure and allowed for straightforward comparisons between groups. Treating party affiliation in this way made it easier to explore whether LGBT status aligns more closely with one party and to evaluate how identity might intersect with partisan representation within the Legislature.
