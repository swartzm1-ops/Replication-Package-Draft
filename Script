##### STEP 1: Examine the scatter plot
# showing the relationship between campaign spending and observed vote share 


linear_plot <- plot(vote_table$campaign_spending, vote_table$observed_vote_share)
print(linear_plot)

# add x line and y line for means
meany <- mean(vote_table$campaign_spending)
meanx <- mean(vote_table$observed_vote_share)

abline(v = meany, col = "black")
abline(h = meanx, col = "black")



##### STEP 2: Calculate linear regression line (i.e., slope) and add to scatter plot
linear_relationship <- lm(data3$party ~ data3$sexuality, data = data3)
summary(linear_relationship)

# Add the linear regression line to the scatter plot
# NOTE: double check the scatter plot is currently in your utilities window!
abline(linear_relationship, col = "red")

##### STEP 3: Plot the residuals

# Plot the residuals
plot(data3$party, data3$sexuality)

# Add a horizontal line at zero to indicate the baseline
abline(h = 0, col = "red")
